# Example of usage of CORS with Cookie
This project is a simple prototype created to help answer a question in [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54942698/cookie-is-not-set-with-expires-date-and-cors).

There is an API project hosted on port 5001, and a Web project hosted on 5000.

A simple web page with a button allow to send a GET request to the API and along with the response a cookie is added with expirty date.
